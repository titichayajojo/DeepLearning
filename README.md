# Deep Learning Course Project

This repository contains the project work for the Deep Learning Course (COMPSCI5103). The project involves exploring various deep learning techniques and implementing models using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview

- **Course**: Deep Learning - COMPSCI5103
- **Objective**: To apply deep learning concepts and techniques to real-world data, with a focus on model implementation and evaluation.
- **Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow, Keras.

## Contents

- **`Titichaya_Vongbusayamas.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the code, analysis, and results of the deep learning project.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/titichayajojo/DeepLearning.git
   cd DeepLearning
